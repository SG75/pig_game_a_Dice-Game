# Pig Game - A Dice Game 🎲

Welcome to the **Pig Game**! This is a classic two-player dice game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🎮 Game Rules
- Players take turns rolling a dice.
- The player’s score for that turn is added to their total score until they roll a `1`.
- If a `1` is rolled, the player loses their current score for that turn and it becomes the other player's turn.
- The first player to reach or exceed the target score (usually 100) wins the game.

## 📝 Features
- **Two-player mode:** Alternate turns for two players.
- **Dynamic scoring:** Real-time score updates based on dice rolls.
- **Hold Option:** Players can choose to hold their score, passing the turn to the other player.
- **Winner Announcement:** Automatic game reset when a player wins.

## 📂 Project Structure
